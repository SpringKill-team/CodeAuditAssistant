<h1>Runtime RCE Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Remote Code Execution (RCE)</strong> is a critical security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a target system. With RCE, attackers may execute system commands, read or modify system data, and potentially gain full control over the targeted server.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks for the usage of the <code>java.lang.Runtime</code> class's <code>exec</code> method and the <code>java.lang.ProcessBuilder</code>. These methods can be exploited to execute system commands, leading to potential RCE vulnerabilities.
</p>
<h3>Inspection Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If it detects the use of <code>Runtime.exec()</code> or instantiation of <code>ProcessBuilder</code>, it flags the code as having potential RCE risks.</li>
    <li>A warning is displayed at these code locations, reminding developers to review the safety of these calls.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    To mitigate the risk of RCE vulnerabilities, developers should avoid using <code>Runtime.exec()</code> and <code>ProcessBuilder</code> directly for executing system commands whenever possible. If command execution is necessary, ensure that all input parameters are strictly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item prompts developers to review command execution logic in their code, ensuring that all inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious inputs from being executed.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For instance, if the code contains the following unsafe calls:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("cmd /c some_command");  // Unsafe
new ProcessBuilder("cmd", "/c", "some_command").start();  // Unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    Developers are advised to thoroughly review these calls and ensure they use safer alternatives or secure methods for executing commands.
