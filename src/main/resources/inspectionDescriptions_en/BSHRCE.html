<h1>BSH RCE Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Remote Code Execution (RCE)</strong> is a critical vulnerability where an attacker can execute arbitrary code on a system through script execution. If BeanShell scripts (e.g., `bsh.Interpreter.eval()`) are executed with unvalidated input, they can pose an RCE risk.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks for calls to methods in BeanShell and Spring scripting that execute scripts, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>bsh.Interpreter.eval()</code></li>
    <li><code>org.springframework.scripting.bsh.BshScriptEvaluator.evaluate()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
    If user input is passed to these methods without proper validation, it is flagged as potentially dangerous due to the risk of remote code execution.
</p>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    It is recommended to validate and sanitize all user inputs before executing them as scripts. Avoid passing raw user input directly to script execution engines. Using predefined scripts or restricting the scope of executable code can also help mitigate risks.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item provides quick fix suggestions, helping developers identify unsafe script execution scenarios and reminding them to perform input validation.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For instance, if the code contains the following unsafe script execution:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
bsh.Interpreter interpreter = new bsh.Interpreter();
interpreter.eval(userInputScript);  // Unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    The recommended fix is to validate <code>userInputScript</code> before executing it.
