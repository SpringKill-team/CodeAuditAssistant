<h1>JDBC Injection Attack Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>JDBC Injection Attack</strong> is a common security vulnerability. Attackers can exploit insecure database connection configurations or inject malicious inputs directly into the code, controlling database connection behavior to perform unauthorized actions, potentially accessing or modifying sensitive data.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks for method calls and class instantiations related to JDBC in the code to identify potentially insecure database connection usage scenarios. It focuses on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Method calls to common JDBC methods such as <code>getConnection</code>, <code>setJdbcUrl</code>, and <code>connect</code>.</li>
    <li>Instantiation of classes that might lead to improper database connection configuration, such as <code>DriverManagerDataSource</code>, <code>HikariConfig</code>, and <code>BasicDataSource</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    To prevent the risks of JDBC injection attacks, developers are recommended to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases, avoiding direct concatenation of user inputs in SQL.</li>
    <li>Use a validated database connection pool configuration, such as HikariCP, and ensure the security of connection URLs.</li>
    <li>Review and restrict database user privileges, ensuring that connections are made using a user with the least required permissions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item alerts developers to potentially insecure database connection usage patterns in their code and suggests adjustments to the connection configuration or the use of more secure methods.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For instance, if the code contains the following insecure JDBC usage:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db?user=admin&password=123");  // Unsafe
new HikariConfig("jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1");  // Unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    The recommended fix is to store the database URL in environment variables or configuration files, and ensure that sensitive information is not hard-coded.
