<h1>SnakeYAML Unserialization Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Deserialization Vulnerabilities</strong> are a critical security issue where attackers can exploit the deserialization process to execute arbitrary code, potentially taking control of the system. Certain deserialization methods in the SnakeYAML library, such as <code>load</code>, <code>loadAll</code>, <code>parse</code>, and <code>loadAs</code>, can pose such a risk if not handled properly.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks for calls to SnakeYAML's <code>load</code>, <code>loadAll</code>, <code>parse</code>, and <code>loadAs</code> methods in the code. If untrusted YAML data is passed into these methods, it could lead to deserialization vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.
</p>
<h3>Inspection Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This item scans for critical methods of the <code>org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml</code> class (such as <code>load</code> and <code>loadAll</code>) and warns developers about potential security risks in these methods.</li>
    <li>When a problematic method call is detected, it flags the code and raises a security warning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    To avoid deserialization vulnerabilities, it is recommended to ensure that any data passed to SnakeYAML is trusted and comes from secure sources. Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly. It is also advised to use whitelisting mechanisms to restrict the types of objects that can be deserialized, or apply strict validation to the input data.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item prompts developers to use safer methods for handling YAML data, such as limiting deserialized object types or adding strong validation before deserializing the data.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For example, the following code has a potential deserialization vulnerability:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
Yaml yaml = new Yaml();
Object data = yaml.load(yamlString);  // Unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    The recommended fix is to use a safer approach with object type restrictions or perform strict input validation:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
Yaml yaml = new Yaml(new Constructor(SafeClass.class));  // Type restriction for safety
SafeClass data = yaml.load(yamlString);  // Safer deserialization
</code>
    </pre>
