<h1>System DOS Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>System Exit Abuse</strong> is a potential Denial of Service (DOS) issue. When methods like <code>System.exit()</code> are called inappropriately, they can cause the entire application to terminate unexpectedly, especially in server or multi-threaded environments. This can impact service availability and result in business interruptions.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks for calls to <code>System.exit</code>, <code>Shutdown.exit</code>, or <code>Runtime.exit</code> in the code. Improper use of these methods may cause the application to terminate abruptly, leading to a potential denial of service situation.
</p>
<h3>Inspection Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If it detects calls to the above system exit methods, it flags the code as potentially risky.</li>
    <li>A warning is displayed at the problematic code locations, advising developers to avoid direct use of these methods.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    It is recommended to avoid direct calls to <code>System.exit()</code> in production code. Instead, use exception handling to manage error conditions or notify the main thread to gracefully shut down services, rather than terminating the JVM abruptly.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item suggests reviewing the use of system exit methods in the code and offers alternative error-handling strategies.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For instance, if the code contains the following unsafe calls:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
System.exit(1);  // Unsafe
Runtime.getRuntime().exit(0);  // Unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    The recommended fix is to replace these with more graceful error-handling methods, such as throwing a custom exception or using a flag to gracefully shut down threads.
