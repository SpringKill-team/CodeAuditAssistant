<h1>OkHttp SSRF Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)</strong> is an attack where an attacker can manipulate an application's HTTP requests to make the server send requests to internal resources it shouldn't access. This can lead to serious issues such as sensitive data leaks and internal service discovery.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks for the use of OkHttp to make HTTP requests in the code, specifically focusing on calls to the <code>url</code> method of <code>com.squareup.okhttp.Request$Builder</code> and <code>okhttp3.Request$Builder</code> classes, as well as other high-risk methods like <code>execute</code> and <code>newCall</code>.
</p>
<h3>Inspection Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Scans the code for instances where OkHttp is used to create HTTP requests, including calls to the <code>url</code> method and executions of <code>execute</code> methods.</li>
    <li>If it detects potential SSRF vulnerabilities, it highlights the problematic parts of the code and prompts the developer to make corrections.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    To prevent SSRF attacks, it is recommended to validate and restrict URLs from external input strictly. Ensure that only expected and verified addresses can be passed to OkHttp request methods. Additionally, consider adding IP address filtering and DNS resolution checks at the application level to prevent unintended access to internal resources.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item prompts developers to review and correct the usage of URL parameters from external inputs, ensuring that only safe URLs are passed to OkHttp requests.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For instance, if the code contains the following unsafe call:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
new OkHttpClient().newCall(new Request.Builder().url(userInput).build()).execute();  // Unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    The recommended fix is to perform strict validation on <code>userInput</code> and ensure it matches expected formats or domains.
