<h1>Kryo Unserialization Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Insecure Deserialization</strong> is a critical security vulnerability. When an application deserializes data from untrusted sources, attackers can craft malicious objects that, when deserialized, may lead to arbitrary code execution on the target system. This risk is particularly relevant when using the Kryo serialization library, as Kryo allows deserializing arbitrary objects.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks if the code calls deserialization methods from the <code>com.esotericsoftware.kryo.Kryo</code> class, such as <code>readObject</code>, <code>readObjectOrNull</code>, and <code>readClassAndObject</code>. These methods could pose a security risk if they deserialize data from untrusted sources.
</p>
<h3>Inspection Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If it detects the use of Kryo's deserialization methods (e.g., <code>readObject</code>), it flags these calls as potential security issues.</li>
    <li>A warning is displayed at the relevant code locations, alerting the developer to the potential dangers of insecure deserialization.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    To avoid insecure deserialization vulnerabilities, it is recommended that developers ensure data sources are trusted when using the Kryo serialization library. Use a strict class whitelist to control which types can be deserialized. Additionally, consider using alternative secure deserialization mechanisms.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item prompts developers to review the contexts in which Kryo deserialization is used, avoid reading data from untrusted sources, and suggests adding a class whitelist for tighter control.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For example, if the code contains the following potentially unsafe call:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
Kryo kryo = new Kryo();
Object obj = kryo.readObject(input, MyClass.class);  // Potentially unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    The recommended fix is to ensure that the <code>input</code> comes from a trusted source and to restrict which classes can be deserialized.
