<h1>Injection Filter Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>SQL Injection</strong> and <strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Injection</strong> are common security vulnerabilities. SQL injection can allow attackers to manipulate SQL queries, potentially giving them access to or control over database data. XSS injection allows attackers to insert malicious scripts, which may steal user information or hijack sessions.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks for class and method names that may be misleadingly perceived as SQL or XSS filters. Certain names, such as <code>SQLFilter</code> or <code>ClearXSS</code>, may give a false sense of filtering security, while these methods or classes may lack actual filtering functionality, creating potential security risks.
</p>
<h3>Inspection Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If a class name matches patterns like <code>SQLFilter</code>, <code>SQLInjectionFilter</code>, or <code>SQLInjection</code>, it flags the class as potentially unsafe and displays a warning for SQL injection risk.</li>
    <li>If a class name contains <code>XSSFilter</code>, <code>XSSClear</code>, or <code>ClearXSS</code>, it indicates potential XSS security risks.</li>
    <li>Similarly, if a method name matches <code>ClearSQL</code>, <code>SQLClear</code>, <code>ClearXSS</code>, or <code>XSSClear</code>, it considers the method potentially unsafe and highlights it accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    For SQL and XSS filters, it is recommended to ensure that the filtering functionality is genuinely effective and avoids misleading naming. Consider using established anti-injection frameworks or libraries (e.g., regular expressions, encoding functions) to properly validate data inputs and prevent injection attacks.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item reminds developers to review the implementations of these classes and methods to ensure they have real SQL or XSS protection capabilities rather than merely misleading names.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For example, the following code includes potentially unsafe class or method names:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
class SQLFilter { ... }  // Potentially unsafe
void ClearXSS(String input) { ... }  // Potentially unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    It is recommended to ensure these classes or methods perform real filtering functions or to use more descriptive names.
