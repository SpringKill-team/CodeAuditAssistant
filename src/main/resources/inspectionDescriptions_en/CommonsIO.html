<h1>Commons IO File Write Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Unsafe file write operations</strong> can lead to file overwriting, path traversal attacks, and unauthorized access to the local file system. Attackers may exploit these issues by controlling the file path or content, leading to files being created or modified in unintended locations, which poses a risk to system security.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks for method calls in the code that use the <code>org.apache.commons.io</code> library for file write operations, including but not limited to <code>FileUtils.write</code>, <code>IOUtils.copy</code>, <code>PathUtils.copyFile</code>, and others. These methods may introduce file write vulnerabilities when provided with unsafe inputs.
</p>
<h3>Inspection Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If it detects calls to file operation methods from <code>commons-io</code> that are in the list of potentially dangerous methods, it flags them as risky file write operations.</li>
    <li>This includes cases where methods like <code>FileUtils.copyFile</code> and <code>writeStringToFile</code> are used without proper validation of paths or input content.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    Developers are advised to ensure that the paths used in file write operations are trusted and that user inputs are thoroughly validated to prevent path traversal and unintended file overwriting. Safer file handling practices or restricting input ranges can help mitigate these risks.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item suggests that developers review the origin of file paths and content to ensure that these inputs do not result in unauthorized file operations, thereby preventing security vulnerabilities.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For instance, if the code contains the following unsafe file operations:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
FileUtils.writeStringToFile(new File("/tmp/userdata.txt"), userInput);  // Unsafe
IOUtils.copy(inputStream, new FileOutputStream("/etc/config"));  // Unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    The recommended fix is to validate the file paths or use safer methods for generating paths.
