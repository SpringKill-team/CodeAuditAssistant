<h1>Script Engine RCE Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Remote Code Execution (RCE)</strong> is a critical security vulnerability where an attacker can execute arbitrary code on a server through input that is not properly validated. RCE vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, server compromise, and even full system takeover.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks for calls to the <code>eval</code> method of the <code>javax.script.ScriptEngine</code> class in the code. The <code>eval</code> method allows for executing dynamic scripts, which, if not properly validated and sanitized, can introduce RCE risks.
</p>
<h3>Inspection Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If it detects calls to the <code>eval</code> method of the <code>javax.script.ScriptEngine</code> class, it considers the code as having potential RCE risks.</li>
    <li>A security warning is displayed at the problematic code location, alerting the developer to the potential risk.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    To prevent RCE vulnerabilities, it is recommended to avoid directly executing user-supplied script content. Developers should restrict the source of executable scripts or apply strict input validation and sanitization before execution. For scenarios where dynamic script execution is necessary, consider using sandboxing or secure isolation mechanisms.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item prompts developers to review any use of the <code>eval</code> method and ensure that inputs are properly validated to prevent potential security issues.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For instance, if the code contains the following unsafe call:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("JavaScript");
engine.eval(userInput);  // Unsafe, potential RCE
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    The recommended fix is to avoid using user input directly or perform validation and sanitization before execution.
