<h1>Hardcoded Credentials Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Hardcoded Credentials</strong> refer to sensitive information such as passwords, keys, and tokens that are directly embedded in the source code. These hardcoded credentials can be easily extracted by attackers, leading to unauthorized access and severe security risks, especially if the codebase is exposed or leaked.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks for sensitive information in the following patterns:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Checks for keywords like <code>password</code>, <code>passwd</code>, <code>pwd</code>, <code>secret</code>, and <code>token</code> in the code.</li>
    <li>Checks for hardcoded passwords in database connection strings.</li>
    <li>Monitors common Java classes and methods such as <code>java.util.Hashtable.put()</code> to ensure sensitive data is not passed.</li>
    <li>Uses entropy analysis to detect possible hardcoded credentials based on the complexity of the strings.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    Developers are advised not to hardcode passwords, keys, or other sensitive information directly in the code. Store such information securely in configuration files or environment variables, and load them during application startup. Use encryption or secure management tools to manage and protect these sensitive credentials.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item provides quick fix suggestions to help developers identify and replace hardcoded credentials, and encourages storing sensitive information in a more secure manner.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For instance, if the code contains the following unsafe hardcoded credentials:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
String password = "mySecretPassword123";  // Unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    It is recommended to change it to:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
String password = System.getenv("DB_PASSWORD");  // Safe
</code>
    </pre>
