<h1>Javax Redirect Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards</strong> are a common security vulnerability. When user-controlled input is passed to redirect or forward methods without validation, attackers can exploit this to perform redirection attacks, tricking users into visiting malicious sites or bypassing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks code that uses redirection and forwarding functions, such as <code>HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect</code>, <code>RequestDispatcher.getRequestDispatcher</code>, <code>Response.seeOther</code>, and <code>Response.temporaryRedirect</code>, to ensure that unvalidated user input is not being passed into these methods. It also checks for instantiation of classes like <code>ModelAndView</code> that could be involved in unsafe redirection operations.
</p>
<h3>Inspection Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Checks whether methods like <code>HttpServletResponse</code> and <code>RequestDispatcher</code> are being called with redirect or forward operations.</li>
    <li>Checks for instantiation of classes like <code>ModelAndView</code>, which may involve view redirection.</li>
    <li>Flags the problematic code and provides warnings to the developer, prompting a fix.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    To prevent unvalidated redirects and forwards, it is recommended to ensure that all URLs or paths passed to redirection methods are properly validated, and avoid directly using user input. Additionally, limiting redirects to trusted domains can reduce the attack surface.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item prompts developers to review the input parameters passed to redirection and forwarding operations, ensuring that their source is safe, and suggests using more secure redirect mechanisms.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For instance, if the code contains the following unsafe redirections:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
response.sendRedirect(userInputUrl);  // Unsafe
request.getRequestDispatcher(userInputPath);  // Unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    The recommended fix is to validate <code>userInputUrl</code> or <code>userInputPath</code>, ensuring that they point to trusted paths or domains.
</p>
