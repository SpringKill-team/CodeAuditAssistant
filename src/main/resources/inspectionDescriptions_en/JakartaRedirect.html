<h1>Jakarta Redirect Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Open Redirect</strong> is a common vulnerability where an application performs redirections based on user-provided URLs. Attackers can exploit this to redirect users to malicious websites, leading to phishing attacks and data leakage.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks the use of <code>Response.seeOther()</code> and <code>Response.temporaryRedirect()</code> methods in Jakarta RESTful Web Services, specifically focusing on whether the URL parameter is derived from unvalidated user input.
</p>
<h3>Inspection Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If these methods use a URL parameter that is derived from unvalidated user input, it is flagged as potentially vulnerable to open redirects.</li>
    <li>Warnings are displayed at insecure code locations, along with suggestions for fixing the issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    Developers are advised to validate user input thoroughly when handling redirect target URLs, ensuring that only legitimate redirect targets are allowed. This prevents users from being redirected to malicious websites.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item provides quick fix suggestions to help developers replace unsafe URL handling with validated inputs.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For instance, if the code contains the following unsafe redirect:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
Response.seeOther(URI.create(userProvidedUrl));  // Unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    It is recommended to validate <code>userProvidedUrl</code> to ensure only trusted URLs are allowed.
