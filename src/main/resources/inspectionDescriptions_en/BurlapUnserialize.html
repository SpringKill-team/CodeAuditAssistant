<h1>Burlap Unserialization Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Remote Code Execution (RCE)</strong> is a critical vulnerability type. Through insecure deserialization, attackers can execute arbitrary code, gaining control over the victim's system or server. In Java environments, Burlap is an XML-based serialization protocol, and its <code>readObject</code> method can be an entry point for attacks when handling unfiltered input.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks for calls to the <code>readObject</code> method of the <code>com.caucho.burlap.io.BurlapInput</code> class, identifying potential insecure deserialization operations. Unvalidated deserialization input may lead to remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, posing a significant security risk to the system.
</p>
<h3>Inspection Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If a call to the <code>BurlapInput</code>'s <code>readObject</code> method is detected, it is considered a potential deserialization risk.</li>
    <li>A warning is displayed at the problematic code locations, prompting the developer to make necessary corrections.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    To mitigate the risk of RCE vulnerabilities, it is recommended that developers thoroughly validate and filter input data before deserialization, ensuring that the data source is trusted. Additionally, consider using more secure deserialization alternatives or custom deserialization methods that control object creation.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item encourages developers to review their deserialization process, suggesting the use of secure serialization frameworks and ensuring data integrity checks during any deserialization operation.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For instance, if the code contains the following unsafe method calls:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
BurlapInput input = new BurlapInput(...);
Object obj = input.readObject();  // Unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    The recommended fix is to ensure that the input data source is controlled and perform integrity checks on the data before deserialization.
