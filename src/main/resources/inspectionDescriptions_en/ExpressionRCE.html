<h1>Expression RCE Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Remote Code Execution (RCE)</strong> is a critical security vulnerability where an attacker can execute arbitrary code through unvalidated input. RCE attacks often lead to complete system takeover, allowing the attacker to run any command or operation.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks for instantiation of the <code>java.beans.Expression</code> class in the code. The <code>java.beans.Expression</code> class can invoke arbitrary methods under certain conditions, making it particularly risky when handling untrusted data.
</p>
<h3>Inspection Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If it detects the instantiation of the <code>java.beans.Expression</code> class, it flags the code as potentially vulnerable to remote code execution.</li>
    <li>It highlights the potential risk locations in the code and provides a warning message, urging the developer to review and fix the issue.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    To prevent RCE vulnerabilities, it is recommended to ensure that input data used with <code>java.beans.Expression</code> is trusted. Avoid using untrusted data to construct instances of this class. Consider using more secure APIs or performing strict validation and sanitization on the input data.
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item prompts developers to review the use of <code>java.beans.Expression</code> in their code and provides security recommendations to reduce the risk of remote code execution.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For example, if the code contains the following potentially unsafe instantiation:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
new java.beans.Expression(target, "methodName", args);  // Potentially unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    The recommended fix is to use a more secure alternative or ensure that <code>target</code> and <code>methodName</code> are trusted and not controlled by a malicious user.
