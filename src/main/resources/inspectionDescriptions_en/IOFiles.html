<h1>File Write Operations Inspection Item</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Type</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Unsafe file write operations</strong> can lead to vulnerabilities such as sensitive data exposure, unauthorized file overwriting, or arbitrary file write. When an application handles file write operations insecurely, attackers may exploit these flaws to create, overwrite, or modify files in the system, leading to data tampering or leakage.
</p>
<h2>What This Item Checks</h2>
<p>
    This item checks for the use of various file writing methods in the code to ensure that they do not pose potential security risks. It identifies common file write classes like <code>java.io.FileOutputStream</code>, <code>java.nio.file.Files</code>, <code>java.io.Writer</code>, and checks whether their write methods are being used in a potentially unsafe manner.
</p>
<h3>Inspection Logic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It scans the code for method calls that match known file write classes and methods, such as <code>write</code>, <code>append</code>, <code>transferTo</code>, and more.</li>
    <li>If it detects a call to these methods that could pose a security risk, it flags the code at the problematic location and prompts the developer to review it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fix Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    To avoid unsafe file write operations, developers are advised to:
<ul>
    <li>Validate file paths and names to ensure that write operations do not overwrite sensitive files or directories.</li>
    <li>Use secure path concatenation methods to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>Implement permission control mechanisms to restrict write permissions.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Quick Fix</h3>
<p>
    This item alerts developers to re-evaluate their file write logic, ensuring no potentially dangerous write methods are used and that appropriate security measures are in place.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    For instance, if the code contains the following unsafe file write operation:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("/tmp/test.txt");
fos.write(data);  // Unsafe
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    The recommended fix is to apply proper file path validation and restriction mechanisms, or to limit the writable directories.
